We congratulate for getting selected for Amazon Intern. Nikhil is also an ardent Python developer who loves to build stuff and automate things. For more insight into his projects, check his [github repo](github.com/nikhilkumarsingh)
Nikhil also takes Python workshops at Coding Blocks and has his own blog .We thank him for sharing his interview experiences with this student community. 

### **PRELIMINARY ROUND**

### Preliminary Round 

**Q1** Given an array find the number of triplets whose sum is less than the given value

**Q2** Given a sequence of magic numbers, find the nth term of the sequence. A magic number is defined as the number that can be generated by the sum of distict powers of 5.

Eg
5	=	5

25	= 	5^2

30	= 5^2 + 5^1

125

130

150 


### **ROUND 1**
**Q1** Given a circular linked list of N nodes, break it into 2 circular linked list of equal size. If n is odd, then either list can contain an extra element.

**Q2** Given a paranthesized expression, detect if contains any redunadant parantheses.


### **ROUND 2**
**Q1** Given a numeric keypad, find the number of sequences of length N that can be generated under the following constraint.

a) All adjacent numbers can be used to generate the next element of the sequence

Eg N = 1

{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

Output : 10

N = 2


{11,12,14, 21, 22, 23, 25 ...}

Output : 36

**Q2** Given a list of stock prices, you have to detemine the maximum profit that can be generated by buying and selling. You can't buy/sell without completing a  transaction.

Eg {30, 50, 100, 60, 80, 20}

Output : 100 - 60 + 80 - 20 = 100

Nikhil suggested an `O(n*n)` solution and interviewer was satisfied.
