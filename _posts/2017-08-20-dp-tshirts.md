In this video, we are going to solve [this](https://www.codechef.com/AUG14/problems/TSHIRTS) problem.  

### Little Elephant and T-Shirts
#### Problem Statement
Little Elephant and his friends are going to a party. Each person has his own collection of T-Shirts. There are 100 different kind of T-Shirts. Each T-Shirt has a unique id between 1 and 100. No person has two T-Shirts of the same ID.
They want to know how many arrangements are there in which no two persons wear same T-Shirt
One arrangement is considered different from another arrangement if there is at least one person wearing a different kind of T-Shirt in another arrangement. 
```
