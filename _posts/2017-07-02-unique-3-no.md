Video Solution by **Prateek Narang**

#### **Difficulty**: 
Medium

#### **Concepts Used**:
Bitmasking

#### **Statement**:
Given a list of numbers where every number is occuring thrice except one number we have to find out the unique number which is occuring just one time.

#### **Explanation**
Since all other numbers are occuring thrice, we need to cancel all the bits occuring thrice(contriubted by repeating numbers) - so we take sum of bits at every positions(in all numbers) and take mod by 3 for every position. We maintain a array of size 64 to handle 64 bit integers. Watch the video to learn more.


#### **Solution**

```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int findUniqueNo(int *a,int n){
     int cnt[64] = {0};

     for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
        ///Extract Bits of Every Number and update the count array

        int i=0;
        int no = a[j];
        while(no>0){
            cnt[i] += (no&1);
            i++;
            no = no>>1;
        }

     }
     /// Take mod of cnt array with 3
     int p = 1;
     int ans = 0;
     for(int i=0;i<64;i++){
        cnt[i] %= 3;

        ans += cnt[i]*p;
        p = p<<1;
     }
    return ans;



}

int main(){
    int a[] = {7,7,3,4,12,6,6,6,3,3,4,4,7};
    int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(int);

    cout<< findUniqueNo(a,n);


return 0;
}
```
