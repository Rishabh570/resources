In this talk, Arnav Gupta talks about dealing with the cross-platform parts specifically of maintaing an Electron project. We’ll touch briefly on some common ground, as to how we can ship a complete server-client architecture (that you might be already hosting as a webserver + website solution) web stack into a single Electron project as a standalone, offline Desktop app. Then we’ll discuss the differences between the Linux, Mac and Windows platforms, and how an Electron developer can make best use of available cross-platform UI concepts, and build truly cohesive interfaces for all three platforms.
