Recently, Fidelity Investments visited NIT Kurukshetra's campus for its recruitment drive. **Parth Dhamija** was selected. We congratulate for getting selected for Fidelity Investments as an Intern. We thank him for sharing his interview experiences with this student community. 

### **PRELIMINARY ROUND**

### Preliminary Round 
 
There were 15 Aptitude questions, 5 Comprehension, 12 technical questions and 45 minutes were allotted for this.

2 coding questions were also there and 30 minutes were alloted to complete question 1 and 15 minutes for question 2.


**Q1.** A company has n officies in n cities. Each office has 3 teams consisting of different number of members. The company decided to give party to one of the offices. On contacting the hotel, the company came to know about a scheme: hotel offers a discount on the minimum number of members in the team, i.e., if an office has team A with 9 members, team B with 8 members and team C with 5 members, 5 members of team A, 5 members of team B and 5 members of team C will be provided discount. The company will have to pay full for 4 members of team A, 3 members of team B and 0 members of team C.
The company wants to avail the maximum discount while reducing its cost.

The **approach** was to avail the maximum discount by selecting the office with min difference amongst member of its team, and if the sum of difference was same in 2 offices, the offices with more number of members was chosen



**Q2.** There are 2 tables :-

 - student table
 - book table

1. *student table fields*-  student_id,date_of_birth,student_name
2. *book table fields* -  book_id,author_name,book_name,student_id

**Input :** 
No.of books and input for every book i.e entries of table fields for every book.
Example:-
1245|rd sharma|mathematics|456

For student same input has to be entered i.e. according to table fields of student.
Example:-
456|30/01/1995|Rahul Gupta

**Output :**
Search name of student who issued input book_name.



### **INTERVIEW ROUNDS**

#### **ROUND 1 : TECHNICAL**
Normal algorithm and data structure related questions were asked. I took the interview into another direction about one of my projects.

#### **ROUND 2 : TECHNICAL**
This was purely project based.

#### **ROUND 3 : HR**
This was the easiest as I had to talk nothing technical but about myself and my future goals. I was also asked where do I see myself 5 years from now.


Overall it was an easy interview process, the direction of interview will depend upon on you where you want to take it.
